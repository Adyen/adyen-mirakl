# adyenMiraklConnector
This application was generated using JHipster 4.14.0, you can find documentation and help at [http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.0](http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.0).

## Development

Please add environment variables for `MIRAKL_SDK_USER`, `MIRAKL_SDK_PASSWORD`, `MIRAKL_ENV_URL`, `MIRAKL_API_OPERATOR_KEY` and `MIRAKL_API_FRONT_KEY` e.g.
update `~/.bashrc` with:
```
export MIRAKL_SDK_USER=<user>
export MIRAKL_SDK_PASSWORD=<pass>
export MIRAKL_ENV_URL=<miraklEnvUrl>
export MIRAKL_API_OPERATOR_KEY=<miraklApiOperatorKey>
export MIRAKL_API_FRONT_KEY=<miraklApiFrontKey>
export MIRAKL_API_FRONT_KEY=<miraklApiFrontKey>
```

Same goes for Adyen: `ADYEN_USER_NAME`, `ADYEN_PASS`, `ADYEN_ENV`, `ADYEN_APP_NAME` and `ADYEN_ENDPOINT`. 
```
export ADYEN_USER_NAME=<user>
export ADYEN_PASS=<pass>
export ADYEN_ENV=<TEST|LIVE>
export ADYEN_APP_NAME=<adyenAppName>
export ADYEN_ENDPOINT=<adyenEndpoint>
```

And run `source ~/.bashrc`



To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

    ./gradlew


For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].



## Building for production

To optimize the adyenMiraklConnector application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war


Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootRepackage -Pprod buildDocker

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
